Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Time Series Data in R

Presenters: Mahesh L Maskey, Kristen Shapiro, Michelle M Tobias, and Alexander I Mandel 

When: April 23, 2019 (Tuesday)
Time: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Prerequisite: Basic knowledge in R (no experience in R is also considered)

Logistic:  Bring your own laptop with recent version of R-studio. Spatial packages like QGIS or ArcGIS are optional 

While NDVI information is very useful in various field of studies like agriculture, crop yield, types of vegetation, plant phenology, climate change, seasonal change and beyond, this workshop has been set up with following objectives:

    to learn how to manipulate remotely sensed images to extract physical quantities like NDVI
    to visualize rsater images and relevant statistics
    to perform sample raster calculations
    to extract NDVI time series from deifferent periods of obesevation
    to visualize spatial dynamics
