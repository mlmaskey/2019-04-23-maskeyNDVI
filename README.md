Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Time Series Data in R

Presenters: Mahesh L Maskey, Kristen Shapiro, Michelle M Tobias, and Alexander I Mandel 

When: April 23, 2019 (Tuesday)
Time: 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM

Prerequisite: Basic knowledge in R (no experience in R is also considered)

Logistic:  Bring your own laptop with recent version of R-studio. Spatial packages like QGIS or ArcGIS are optional 
While NDVI information is very useful in various field of studies like agriculture, crop yield, types of vegetation, plant phenology, climate change, seasonal change and beyond, this workshop outlines a simple method to extract NDVI from Landsat remotely sensed images over different periods of year in R. In addition, participants will explore widely used R-functions in visualizing both temporal and spatial dynamics of NDVI.
